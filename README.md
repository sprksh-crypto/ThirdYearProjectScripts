# Swathi Prakash | Project | VR Astrophysics Simulation


## Overview
This repository contains code for the Astrophysics Simulation project, delivered via the Final Year Project in Physics at King's College London in 2020. This project was done using Unity, the game development platform, and C#, the programming language; in order to produce a true-newtonian based model of astrophysical phenomenon. This project spans the spheres of : educational material, modelling methods, game development, UI/UX design, and more. 

All C# code is included, however the .AI files are not, for copyright infringement purposes. The C# code is separated into final implemented code and other, which will be test or intermediate working code.

Lastly, the final run through for the project (on the Unity interface) is uploaded to Youtube, and can be accessed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cuq8VIjVEHc&t=11s). All other supplementary videos that complement the development process can be accessed in this Youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk04vZL3eJtP7moeVNKAL8wm_yTUieotg).
